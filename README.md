This simple C program calculates the sum of the digits in a 3-digit number. Hereâ€™s how it works:

The user is prompted to input a 3-digit number.
The program extracts the individual digits (units, tens, and hundreds) from the input number.
It adds these digits together to compute the sum.
Finally, the program displays the sum of the digits.

structured programming basics/two_swap.c

The swap function takes two integer pointers as arguments,store them in memory locations a and b,add the values of a and b then stores the results in a. This is done using the function *a =*a = *b. The value of b is obtained by subtracting the originalvalue of b which is stored in a. This is done using the function *b = *a - *b.
This approach works by utilizing the properties of arithmetic operations. By adding and subtracting the values in a specific order, the original values of the variables can be swapped without using a third variable.

structured programming basics/reverse.c

This program takes a 3-digit number as input, extracts its digits one by one, and forms the reverse number by multiplying each number with its variables.

structured programming basics/remainder.c

This approach works by utilizing the properties of division and subtraction. By calculating the quotient and product of the division, the remainder can be obtained by subtracting the product from the dividend
